# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- **Credentials Auto-Discovery (`agy-multi creds`)**: Subcommand with `--save` flag that automatically detects and extracts built-in Google Antigravity OAuth client credentials directly from the installed host binary (`agy`), securely saving them to `~/.config/agy-multi/env` (mode 0600) and `~/.bashrc`.
- **Automatic Env Loading**: Both CLI (`agy-multi`), runner wrappers, and HTTP dashboard server automatically load `~/.config/agy-multi/env` if present.
- **Low Quota Warning State**: Yellow warning status badge (`LOW_WEEKLY` / `status-warning`) when weekly quota drops below 20%, alerting users to upcoming exhaustion while keeping the account relay-eligible as a fallback.
- **Automated Installer Configuration**: `install.sh` now automatically runs `agy-multi creds --save` to enable 24/7 background token refresh out-of-the-box.
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Added `tests/test_creds.py` with 100% test coverage for OAuth extraction, environment loading, and credential saving idempotency.

### Changed
- **Official Order Alignment**: Quota display order now strictly aligns with official Google Antigravity semantics: **5-Hour rolling quota first**, followed by **Weekly quota second** across Web Dashboard cards, status pills, and CLI outputs.
- **High-Density Capsule Progress Bar**: Redesigned progress meters into sleek self-contained capsules (`.capsule-meter`) with embedded countdown and percentage indicators, adaptive color shifting (green > 20%, yellow <= 20%, red <= 0%), frosted glass text badges for guaranteed contrast, and elimination of redundant section subtitles.


### Security
- Maintained a strict **zero hardcoded secrets** policy in the repository: all OAuth secrets are dynamically extracted from local binaries or read from environment variables/local configuration files (`~/.config/agy-multi/env`), verified by automated test assertions.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- Multi-account environment isolation with `$HOME` sandbox mapping under `~/.gemini-profiles/`.
- Safe symlink mechanism that mirrors necessary user dotfiles while strictly isolating `.gemini/` and sensitive credential stores (`.ssh`, `.aws`, `.gnupg`, etc.).
- Process runtime tracking via `/proc` to safely monitor active PID allocations.
- Real-time Web Dashboard with token telemetry, official quotas, and account status.
- CLI suite: `init`, `list`, `status`, `run`, `relay`, `login`, `add`, `edit`, `remove`, `install`.
- Smart conversation relay with SQLite online snapshot backup and hot profile failover.
- Backward compatibility alias `gemini-switch` and one-click shortcuts (`agy-1`, `agy-2`, `agy-auto`).
